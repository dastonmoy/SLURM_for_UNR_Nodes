# SLURM for UNR Nodes
Please use the attached SLURM script to run jobs in LS-Dyna. Change the working directory, email and job properties according to your need. This script utilized [PMIx](https://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html) to run MPI inside the server.

Thanks go to newwellz2 (Zachary Newell) for helping me develop this script.
